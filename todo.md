# Endian Alpha To-do List

## This Update (5.1.5):
- Add a way to **update all physics** objects *implicitly*
- Handle *incoming object data* from the simulation on the client
- Add function to the server that *sends incoming player data* from clients to the simulation, so that **players can interact with objects that live in the simulation**.
