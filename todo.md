# Endian Alpha To-do List

## This Update (5.1.3):
- Clean up code from the addition of physics
- Implement **jumping**
- Figure out why the game is *jittery*, [this seems to be a good lead](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52853630/cannon-js-how-to-prevent-jittery-shaky-blocks).
- Clean up some of the networking and seperate it, to make **singleplayer** easier to add in the near future.
- Add a way to **update all physics** objects *implicitly*
