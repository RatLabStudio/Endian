# Project Endian
*Alpha v5.1.4*

## What is Endian
**Endian** is a project that I have been working on for a while now. It is a 3D space game that will have multiplayer, space ships, guns, and more! I hope to build a smooth and robust voxel engine, and a solid player controller so that the game feels nice and snappy.

## How it is Being Developed
I am building this version of the game using JavaScript, with the graphics library known as [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). I have made a basic prototype of the game, featuring the player controller and multiplayer connectivity.

## How to Play
You can play the game at [endian.ratlabstudio.com](https://endian.ratlabstudio.com). This is a public test site, so keep in mind that there will be bugs and errors at some points as I work on the game.

## Multiplayer
The multiplayer in this game will is created with [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), and all players play on the same public server with each other. I would like to add co-op exploration, and player-versus-player combat to the engine for an enjoyable multiplayer experience.
